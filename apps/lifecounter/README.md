[Life Counter](http://dancmj.github.io/apps/lifecounter/app.html)
============
So one morning I was playing Magic the Gathering with my cousin and we were looking for a life counter app on our phones and well, we struggled for a little while when I said to myself "Hey why don't I make one?". 

So here it is! I made the web-app while watching the oscars. Sadly when I got home I did something stupid (testing the `git clean` command) and well, I had to make everything again, cool thing about this is that the 2nd time it just took me an hour.

It's easy to use:
- Click on the top of to increase the player's life counter by 1.
- Click on the bottom of to decrease the player's life counter by 1.
- Hold `shift` while clicking to increase/decrease by 5.
