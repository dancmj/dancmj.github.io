**Apologies!** This will be a very personal post. I don't feel like talking about my job or coding, I just feel like writing so I'll just dump whatever comes into my mind. Read my old posts for more interesting stuff.

--------

My reading skills are improving! I'm almost done with [Creativity Inc](http://www.amazon.com/Creativity-Inc-Overcoming-Unseen-Inspiration/dp/0812993012) by [Edwin Catmull](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Edwin_Catmull) and has many lessons on how to be a better leader and make your failures and errors a really good asset on honing your skills. I still want to read [Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain](http://www.amazon.com/Drawing-Right-Side-Brain-Definitive/dp/1585429201) by Betty Edwards and see if that helps me at all. I'm pretty sure it will! But I haven't put it on my priority list.

I'd like to learn many things about the world and how stuff works, about my ongoing blockers and how to overcome them but most importantly, I'd like to learn how to take better care of the important people in my life that surround me. Most of the time I feel like I'm not showing them how much they mean to me or I'm not doing enough to take care of them, I try my hardest everyday to make them feel safe and loved, I know that it's not my obligation to take care of everything they do, but they are the only thing that make me want to wake up every day.

While you try your best for everyone else, sometimes you miss the obvious. Sometimes while you think you see everything, you try and look at so many things at the same time that you miss what is standing right in front of you, you stop seeing the most important thing that you should hold the closest to your heart and what you should take care of the most. Your own drive and fuel for life... your own happiness. Just try your hardest to happy and take care of yourself. Believe it or not, there's many humans thinking about you right now, and they want to see you again.

So I guess everything else is fine, I don't have much to write about this time. I wish I did.

Take a listen to a beautiful song. Never Meant by American Football.
