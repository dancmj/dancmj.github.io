## I'm scared of being a disappointment

I hope to someday overcome my mild case of Impostor Syndrome. The more I try learn stuff, so it happens that I also learn how much stuff I do not know or understand, so I'm less likely to actually do stuff. Ironically, I **know** that the only way to actually accomplish something is to "Fail often and fail fast" or "*[JUST DO IT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXsQAXx_ao0)*" but I just can't seem to overcome my fear of starting out and being wrong about everything. I admit it, I just can't get that out of my head, I know the only way to get good at something is to start doing it, but I can't! I'm scared to fail, I'm scared to be a HUGE disappointment! A lot of people tell me "You'll do good, trust me". I trust you guys, I just don't trust myself with such a huge responsibility of being successful. How can I be good at something with this kind of stuff in my head? I keep stressing about that.

## Libros

* I finished [The Game Narrative Toolbox](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25710839-the-game-narrative-toolbox). Really good insight and advice from the view of many AAA narrative designers. Being a narrative designer seems like a pretty good position to work on. I do recommend this book if you'd like to learn what does a narrative designer do and how to become one! By the way, make sure to read [this article](https://medium.com/@kindofstrange/game-industry-101-the-power-of-online-networking-e59edcdb2f4e#.bqrjzpveq) by Tara J. Brannigan. It has really good advice on how social networking does matter if you're into the game industry.
* I read [The Culture Code](https://www.amazon.com/Culture-Code-Ingenious-Understand-People/dp/0767920570). It teaches you how everything has a certain "code" and how people live by it. It gave me a pretty cool perspective on how people view and use products. I recommend it to people who don't mind reading about marketing and stuff like that.
* I also read [Artificial Intelligence for Humans: Volume 1](http://www.heatonresearch.com/aifh/vol1/). Really good refresher on fundamental AI algorithms since I barely understood the courses I took in college. Would recommend it to anyone interested on learning AI regardless if you have previous knowledge on AI.

## Now Playing

* **Pokémon Alpha Sapphire**: I've been trying to fill a [living pokédex](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Living_Pok%C3%A9dex). And yes, Pokémon GO is awesome.
* **[Antichamber](http://www.antichamber-game.com/)**: It's messing so much with my mind. It's an amazingly well crafted puzzle. Go play it. NOW.
* **Heroes of the Storm**: I've never been into MOBA games, but I have to play any kind of game if I want to be a good game designer. Props to the designers, for my first MOBA game I have to admit I enjoyed it a lot, the turorial was extremely good explaining everything! I just  need to know the characters better and try not to get hooked so much.
* **Hearthstone**: So good, so simple and so addictive. I'm still really bad at this game but I'll get the hang of it soon. Message me if you'd like to play with me or kick my ass (in the game, of course).
* **World of Warcraft**: I've got to admit, I didn't get as addicted as I thought I would. I'm pretty sure I need to meet a pro wow player so she get's me hooked to it. I'm sure I'll post something on reddit so someone shows me what's so good about it.
* **Goat Simulator**: I... I just don't know what to feel while playing this. On a side note Goat Simulator MMO's environments are beautiful!

## What's Next?

I have no idea. Getting over my insecurity seems like a good idea, I've been trying for years and honestly I haven't found a good way to deal with it. I hope I do soon.

Oh yeah! Portal 2, Undertale & Bastion are on my To-Play list, too.

This post's song is **Waiting for the End** by **Linkin Park**. This song has special meaning for me, reminds me of 2011~2012 when times were simpler for me (I guess some people might call me dramatic). I had no plans for the future, no job, I didn't care about school, learning or my college degree, I played video games 24/7, I played a lot of Minecraft, partied everyday if I could and I just went with the drift. I didn't even think about making the most out of my time, and didn't even worry about developing my skills or what would become of me in the years to come. I don't regret any of that (I made tons of friends and met pretty cool people), but it does make me think about my own self and ponder about how much my goals and my own life has changed.

**You are an awesome human being, be happy, stay safe and hug your loved ones. Thanks for reading.**
