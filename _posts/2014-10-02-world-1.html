<p>Yesterday I was at the computer lab working on some homework when one of the freshmen came up and asked me: "Hey, I was talking with some guys earlier and they said you know how to make games, I'd like to learn how to make games. How can I start? I don't care if it is just a little square moving on the screen, I want to do anything." I started telling him about some simple concepts and recommending engines.</p>
<p>After a little while of talking about our favourite games and genres he just thanked me and left. After that I kept thinking about it and remembered some other friends that have asked me the same before. What if I taught them? It can't be that hard, right?</p>
<p>Today I got an idea and gathered a group of people interested on making games, I was quite surprised about the amount of people interested on the subject. So I instantly thought of C# and XNA and how easy it is to make a game and reinforce the concept of Object Oriented Programming, everyone liked the idea and were willing to spend some hours learning, also, I also could use the practice again since I haven't made a game on XNA in about two years.</p>
<p>I went with the dean and asked him if he could lend me a classroom just for an hour every other day for us to have some space and teach them XNA. I didn't get the answer I expected, he actually told me he liked the idea and we could make it even somewhat more official, give me a fixed schedule, register the class and gather up some certificates for me and the people I'll be teaching to. I didn't expect that at all, I'm really looking forward to it!</p>
<p>I'll be following some chapters from the book <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/xna-40-game-development-example-beginners-guide">XNA 4.0 Game Development by Example: Beginner's Guide</a> by Kurt Jaegers. The code and structure is amazingly good and the learning curve on the book is really low. I always recommend that book to people new to game development.</p>
