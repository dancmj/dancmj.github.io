Hey, I'm having a good time right now and so should you!

It's almost 2016 and I can't believe the amount of stuff I got accomplished this year! I'll write something about it so I don't forget it.

## The Art of Game Design

This game design book by Jesse Schell is amazing, I finished reading it a couple days ago and man, it's just so well written. If you're interested even just one bit on game design (or not), get this book no doubt.

The last part is really interesting because the whole book is kind of technical and explains everything in a really professional manner but the last couple pages are written in a really personal way, talking to you directly and explaining why designing games conveys a big responsibility.

## ImpactJS Tutorials

I've been using [ImpactJS](http://impactjs.com/) for my new game projects and at the same time, publishing all of the progress I make in a tutorial format so I don't forget how I did everything and so people can follow along too. The internet has taught me so much my whole life so I guess it's time I publish some material that can teach other people on the web to do stuff.

## Books?

I've started reading Scott Roger's "Level Up!", it's pretty good so far and much different to Schell's book (I think I've already talked about this on a previous post). I also started Scott McCloud's "Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art" and so far I've learned about the history of comics and how can people relate to letter and drawing abstractions. This'll be very useful when designing characters and storylines on future projects.

## The site's status

Before continuing with the second part of the tutorial, I have to finish setting up some stuff such as syntax highlighting on the site and the about / games sections. I have to finish all of that first before actually continuing with the tutorials so they can look and feel professional.

This post's song is [Alpha by C418](https://c418.bandcamp.com/album/minecraft-volume-beta). I haven't played minecraft in some time I'll be sure to do so on my vacations!
