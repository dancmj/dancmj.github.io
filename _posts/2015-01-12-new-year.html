<p>In case you didn't know, I'm in (well, used to be) a rock band called "
  <a href="http://loscasablancamusic.bandcamp.com/">Los Casablanca</a>". A couple days ago we got the project on a hiatus for the time being, this was because at the moment all of us in the band are getting very busy with other jobs. In my case means more time to code and finish my other projects (my games, the graph algoirthms, getting some front end done on this blog) and finally see the progress that I've needed!</p>
<p>So what's the plan?</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h4>Games</h4>
    <p>I'll be uploading my games made in Unity3D &amp; Phaser and try to explain most of the code that I've used on each game.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Graphs</h4>
    <p>Most of the algorithms are finished and I will be explaining each one from top to bottom. This is the post that I'm most excited about.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>University Assignments</h4>
    <p>Yep, still going on with this. I'm aware that some people that started classes with me are already done, this kind of bothers me most of the time. Whenever I keep thinking about what I've done on the past few years while enrolled in the university, I realize that I've treated it just like my other projects, halting it whenever something more important (at least to me) comes up and focusing completely on just one thing at a time. So yeah, I'm ok! (Obviously I'd rather be done with school, but it will just be an extra semester, how bad can that be?)</p>
    <p>This semester I enrolled on Pattern Recognition (Just a fancy name for Applied AI) and from the algorithms I make, I'll try adapting them so they can work on the games I make! If everything goes as planned, I'll be creating a post for each algorithm too!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Internship</h4>
    <p>Finally! After two tries, I got an internship at Nearsoft Inc. and I'm a bit proud of myself! I feel like I've finally got something awesome going on. I'll be starting on february and I have to create a presentation about static websites. I'll try to create it on HTML and post it on my blog, too.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Here's the song for this post:
  <b>Fronteras by Los Casablanca</b>
  (that's me on the bass!). My favourite song to play live.</p>
