I made a simple phaser game, it is a clone of the game Flappy Bird. I learned this from <a href="http://www.lessmilk.com/">Thomas Palef</a> following his tutorials. I made it a little harder that the regular one, the 'bird' is a little heavier this time so be ready to tap the spacebar a lot!

I'll keep updating the game adding sprites, sounds, menu, etc. Before redoing this game on phaser I honestly had forgotten how simple and powerful the phaser framework was, I would recommend it to anyone.
