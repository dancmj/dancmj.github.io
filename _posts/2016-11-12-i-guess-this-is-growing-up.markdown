*"When there's an elephant in the room, introduce them."* <br> - **Randy Pausch**


Alright, following that advice I must tell you that I'm not feeling that well. I miss my friends, I haven't been able to see them as much as I wanted to lately and many other sudden changes in my life so this might influence my writing. Here I go.

## Lately...

I've read many books and listened to many lectures so I noticed they wouldn't fit in a single post. I've decided to split book reviews & my personal thoughts on different posts. Doing this will also make sure that the book reviews are not so short and that blog-posts are not that long.

Gaming stuff and achievements will also be included within my personal blog posts since games are a pretty cool experience (hence the Wind Waker cover of this post).

Another cool plan that I have is to make a summary of my weekly learnings from the Vancouver Film School so I don't forget what I've learned and you guys follow me through my adventures on Canada. I'm pretty excited!

## You owe this to yourself

Please take an hour of your time to watch [The Last Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lkzyKqiIi0) by Randy Pausch. It's a really good talk about how to achieve your childhood dreams and how to live a better life. Many lessons to learn here. Seriously, please watch it!

## I'm leaving home

So in approximately one month, I'll be leaving Hermosillo for at least a year. Maybe it's not much but I've never been away from home for so long and believe it or not, I'll miss the heat of this place.

I don't know when I'll be back and I have no idea if I'll get a job there or not. I'm kinda thrilled, excited and intrigued all at the same time. I'll have good company on Vancouver, though. My friend Luis will be there and I'm pretty sure I'll meet lots of awesome people over there!

## games

I've only been playing **The Wind Waker**. Pretty refreshing re-run and the changes for the Wii U are pretty cool, I liked the MiiVerse integration and the way they've updated the graphics to make them look even more cartoony. You should check it out if you have the time.

Also, I've been playing **Age of Mythology** with my friend Yisus, he loves this game so much, it's really funny.

## Some thoughts

I've received comments regarding my new habit of reading many self-help books. While it is true that I've been reading a lot of them, I feel kinda bummed (since I think they've been beneficial to me by helping me with my insecurity problems) by being told that reading self-help books is a waste of time and one can improve just by getting over whatever problem you have. I guess I'm not that good so I have to read advice printed on paper so I can make a better version of me.

I should write more on my blog, I've skipped some monthly posts. The problem is that I'm pretty indecisive regarding my blog's purpose. Is it a place to vent? Is it a place where I should show off my non-existing professional achievements? Should I write on a selfish manner just to talk about me or to help others? Why should I share it then? I guess I'll find out eventually.

I've also been thinking that there's people like you that take their precious time to read my thoughts, and I'd like to let you know I'm forever grateful. Those random comments I receive from you guys really keep me going. People have told me my blog helps them by checking out the stuff I recommend or just by reading what happens to me makes them think about themselves. So if you're reading this, *thank you*.

So that's it for the past two months. Be happy and be nice to other humans around you. Thanks for reading! I'll leave you with a pretty unique song by Misha Mansoor's and Elliot Coleman's side project: **Of Man Not Of Machine** - **Epic Fail**.
