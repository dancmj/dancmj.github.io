Hello!

I just revamped the site and it looks awesome! It finally feels like some sort of website from the year 2015, I found the [Kasper theme](https://github.com/rosario/kasper) while looking for jekyll plugins. Funny enough, this theme is ported from the [Ghost CMS](https://ghost.org/)'s default theme which I was planning on switching to instead of jekyll.


## Busy Busy as a QA
Anyways, I've been really busy the last couple months, new position at my job (oh yeah I landed the job at Nearsoft as a QA!), reading, and redoing this blog, got a PS4 and a Wii U (to study the games, of course!) so I haven't been able to code anything on the [g.raffe](https://github.com/dancmj/g.raffe) project. This position has been great with me, it's pretty non-stressful and since I don't really code much, that makes me want to code a lot more on my side projects.

## Game Design Books
I'm almost done reading [The Art of Game Design](http://www.amazon.com/Art-Game-Design-Lenses-Second/dp/1466598646/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1447643428&sr=8-1&keywords=the+art+of+game+design) by [Jesse Schell](http://www.jesseschell.com/) which has been an amazing and incredible book about game design and all of it's aspects. Seriously, if you ever need game design reference, you should use this book. Another great book, [Scott Roger's](http://www.giantbomb.com/scott-rogers/3040-36702/) [Level Up! The Guide to Great Video Game Design](http://www.amazon.com/Level-Guide-Great-Video-Design/dp/1118877160/ref=pd_sim_14_4?ie=UTF8&dpID=61hKRUC9RBL&dpSrc=sims&preST=_AC_UL160_SR127%2C160_&refRID=1P9MGESB8G4Z61P6HF0Y) is looking very promising so far, I'm only 100~ pages in and its really light compared to The Art of Game Design. I feel as if Schell's is more of a deep theory book used in college and Roger's is more of a *"I found a good workflow when game designing and why I recommend working like this"* book. I would recommend both books to aspiring game designers who never got formal game design education like me.

## I <3 my PS4 / Wii U!
I haven't been gaming this much in years! I honestly didn't know, but I kinda needed to play games now that I think about it, I mean I've been playing PC games this past years but sometimes I just wanna lay on my couch and not on my desk. These are my favorites:

* **Mario Maker**: It's amazing how many things one can create if given the right tools. If you've ever thought about practicing your level design skills, this is definitely a great game for that. I have some levels online, check them out!
* **Uncharted Collection**: The [uncharted games](http://www.unchartedthegame.com/en-us/games/uncharted-collection) have a very unique taste. They just feel right! The controllers, the level design, the gameplay, how it teaches you to play even without noticing. If you ever have the chance, take your time and analyze the levels on the game, you'll see many really good design patterns at the right times which is something hard to accomplish. This game has convinced me of buying The Last Of Us. Props to [Naughty Dog](http://www.naughtydog.com/)!
* **The Journey**: Although I think it's pretty short, it's awesome how a simple mountain can do so much. I loved this game. The graphics as well as the soundtrack are beautiful and I like the narrative being simple lights on the wall. Check it out!

I bought many others but those three were the ones that caught my attention, add me on PSN if you ever wanna play. <span style=" color: #2980b9">PSN ID: dancmj</span>

## ImpactJS
So, I've been asking questions to many developers and played [Cross-Code](http://www.cross-code.com/). I've decided to buy a license to use the [ImpactJS](http://impactjs.com/) on all of my future games for HTML. It's just unbelievable the kind of quality that is seen on those games and they're made on JS for the web! I've making games on [Phaser](http://phaser.io/) but I'm still not convinced enough to use it on a big project. I'll be working on them soon!

## What's new with the blog?
Apart from regular blog posts, I'll now use it to host my developer diaries for any apps and games I make and create tutorials for any kind of stuff I come up with, be it how to create *x* kind of game or how to use *y* framework, I'm really excited! This'll help me remember some complicated stuff on the future and hopefully contribute to the internet which has helped me with everything I know.

Thank you for reading this wall of text. Please leave a comment / suggestion on the comment section below the video, it would mean alot to me!

Today's song is an old one, **With you, Friends by Skrillex**. So many good memories.
