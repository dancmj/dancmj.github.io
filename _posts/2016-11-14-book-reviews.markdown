## Books

#### [Soft Skills](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23232941-soft-skills) by **John Z. Sonmez** <sup>(Audiobook)</sup>
It has some pretty good advice on many things that you as a software developer need to be aware of and many self-improving tips regarding your health and productivity. I'd recommend this book to anyone interested on realizing what *"little things"* you are missing whether you're a programmer or not.

#### [The Power of Habit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12609433-the-power-of-habit) by **Charles Duhigg** <sup>(Audiobook)</sup>
It leads a pretty good study explaining the many types of habits we all do and how people have tried for a long time to understand them. There's many case studies ranging from Rosa Parks, King's Cross fire on 1987, a compulsive gambler and many more. I'd recommend it to people who are curious on understanding the human mind.

#### [The 10x Rule](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10339170-the-10x-rule) by **Grant Cardone** <sup>(Audiobook)</sup>
This book has changed me so much. My goals, my dreams, my efforts, my relationships. This is a very motivating book which will teach you about the "10x Rule" which is basically a mindset you set upon yourself to always be hungry for success, do massive actions to be successful, to improve yourself and aim for the highest and wildest of dreams. I'd recommend this book to anyone who is a big dreamer and feels like life actually has something else to offer rather than their current circumstances. Here's my favorite quote: *"I'd rather commit to my dreams and goals and be disappointed rather than never committing and be disappointed."*.

#### [The Perfect Bait](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16095123-the-perfect-bait) by **Bobby Chiu**
Bobby Chiu talks about the problems he encountered while working on his career path. Very good advice and a good insight on how he managed to overcome them. He also talks about what success means to him and how he became someone in the animation industry. I'd recommend this book to anyone on the art scene, you'll feel related to many of the topics of this book. This book was recommended to me by my animator friend Luis de la Rosa, make sure to check out his fanpage [here](https://www.facebook.com/TheArtOfLemur). He's one of the people who convinced me to go study game design to Vancouver Film School, so I owe him big time.

#### [The Checklist Manifesto](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6667514-the-checklist-manifesto) by **Atul Gawande**
Very interesting book on how something as small as a checklist can actually change the whole world's way of approaching many kind of problems. Ranging from reducing the rate of errors that occur on many surgeries to how to handle emergencies on commercial aircraft. Very fast lecture, I'd recommended to everyone.

#### [The War of Art](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1319.The_War_of_Art) by **Steven Pressfield**
A pretty different way on how to view your creations, he talks about how everyone has a Muse and how all of us are just a conduct of the Muses and how we're channeling their will. Very poetic in my opinion. I'd recommend this book to all of you artists looking for inspiration.

#### [The Last Lecture](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2318271.The_Last_Lecture) by **Randy Pausch**
If you were diagnosed with an illness that gave you 3 months to live and you had the opportunity to give one last lecture, what would it be about? If you don't have the time to read a 200 page book, at least do me a favor and [watch his lecture on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo). This man spent some of his last days on earth preparing this lecture, I can assure you this lesson will teach you something valuable.

## Videos and Lectures

#### [The Last Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lkzyKqiIi0) by **Randy Pausch**

This covers everything the book does except his personal life. Do yourself a favor and watch this lecture.

#### [How to use a Journal]() by **Jim Rohn**

One of the coolest things I've done with my life. Purchase a nice journal and follow Jim's advice. Having a journal with you makes sure ideas are being stored in a suitable place and writing on a journal can give you a way to figure it all out since you can analyze what you have written and creates a space between you and your dilemmas.
Jim is asked why spend so much on an empty book, and he responds with: *"Why put a million dollar idea in a 10Â¢ book?"*.

#### [Sharing makes you bigger than you are]() by **Jim Rohn**

This just takes five minutes and it's very motivating and makes a lot of sense. By sharing, you make people think and ponder, you can make people happier and by extent, you yourself become bigger. And quoting Bobby Chiu: *"By sharing once, you learn twice"*.

#### [Master Any Skill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSq9uGs_z0E) by **Tim Ferris**

Tim explains the **"D.I.S.S."** method which helps on becoming an expert on any given skill on a short amount of time by dissecting activities to their most basic parts. It's pretty funny and interesting, you should check it out!

#### [Your Brain on Videogames](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FktsFcooIG8) by **Daphne Bavelier**

A pretty cool TED Talk that illustrates how videogames can be similar to wine in a sense that, in reasonable doses they can be good for health.

## GDC Talks

#### [Leading a Creative Life in the Land of "No"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9P20Jskwmo) by **Bob Bates**

 Pretty good talk about how to keep your creativity up and running and how by practicing creativity every day it can become a way of life. He says you need to:

* Learn your craft
* Understand your creative self
* Understand what motivates you
* Pick a good space for the job
* Learn new things
* Manage your time: He insists this is the most important. I use the pomodoro technique to manage time and increase productivity and it has worked wonders, try it out!

#### [The Importance of Nothing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ99gAb4T0o) by **Jim Brown**

Jim teaches us about how he uses negative space to be a better level designer and how sometimes unknowingly, details can harm the level design using his two decades of experience as a source. As he says: *"Don't forget to look at what's not there"*. Recommended to any game design enthusiast, it's pretty eye opening!
