### At least, another post!

It took me quite a while to write another post. Two months I last felt like writing, so I'm quite eager right now! *Wooh!*

So let's try and remember what I did these last two months.

### Loading...

After a month of doing a big scavenger hunt for many papers required for my Canadian Visa I finally sent them all! I also renewed my American Visa and my Mexican Passport. It wasn't as much trouble as I expected, so that was a nice surprise.

Oh and in other smaller news I finished university and got my Computer Science Degree. Yay me!

### Livres et vidéos

<sub>**Disclaimer**: *I've seen a shit ton of GDC talks so please don't blame for recommending many of them. All of them are AWESOME!*</sub>

* **Ghosts of Onyx**: With this book I discovered I'm into military novels. Set in the Halo universe, the inception of the Spartan-III program and many stories which lead to a single melting point, are narrated on this book by Eric Nylund. Halo nerds should read this book, definitely.
* **New Blood**: Also set in the Halo universe, pretty much a story on how Edward Buck became a Spartan-IV. **BTW** If you haven't seen [the Halo 3: ODST trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjamhIPVvnI) do it now, it always gives me the chills.
* **Healthy Habits of a Successful Game Maker**: [This short and simple GDC talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eNbyZ6Y7xA) by Lauren Scott has many tips and recommendations for people trying to get involved in the industry. I would say, this is the one I'd recommend the most of all of the GDC talks I've seen. So many important things that are so simple but so important that they're easy to forget.
* **Portal 2: Making a sequel to a game that doesn't need one**: Portal is considered by many a masterpiece with a perfect ending. How do you create a sequel to it? The guys at Valve talk about how they take the challenge on [this 2012 GDC talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYFvwbby2YM).
* **The Bloodline System of Massive Chalice**: [Brad Muir](https://twitter.com/mrmooear) gives us a nice introspective on the problems that arose while designing Massive Chalice when creating a system which basically forces you to change characters over time and why designing a game based around the human lifecycle is hard. [Here's the GDC Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6C2cLYOIeA)!
* **Creating the Ultimate Antagonist**: A very good analysis on the Joker character of The Dark Knight movie (my favorite movie ever!) and how one can create the perfect antagonist for a hero. Everyone should watch [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFUKeD3FJm8).

### Much, much gaming!

I'm happy to say I've been gaming more and more, which feels like a good accomplishment! It has been a while since I last tried new games and actually enjoyed video games without feeling much pressure.

* **Halo 5**: Apparently Halo 5 Collector's edition was $250 USD when it came out (I've blown some cash on collectibles but that's a little bit too much). Long story short, I own a statue of Master Chief and Spartan Locke on my TV Desk now for only $60 USD! So I end up buying this game which I don't even have the console for (my cousin David ended up lending me his Xbox One). The game is VERY (I mean **VERY**) well polished and detailed in every aspect of it's gameplay, mechanics and dynamics. The guys at 343 did a really good job on modernizing and re-vitalizing the Halo franchise as seen on [this GDC talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmJ4ASWDdc) by 343 Industries' [Ryan Darcey](http://www.ryandarcey.com/). That talk alone convinced me to buy the game (I recommend this talk to anyone interested on game design and balancing).
* **Shovel Knight**: Yacht Club games has created a very interesting game here. Not only thanks to the amazing and accurate NES ambient but because of the way they handled all of the knights in the game. I was surprised to find out when I beat the game the first time that I was able to play the next campaign with a new Knight and he plays completely different! How awesome is that? Go check out this game if you got a chance!
* **Battlefield 4**: Never actually owned a Battlefield game before in my life. I can say it's extremely fun! I love vehicular combat, the massive maps, the class system, 32 vs 32 Conquest Battles and all the funny unexpected things one can experience while playing with friends.
* **Spelunky**: Can't say much about the game. I saw it recommended online, bought it and I honestly don't know what to think. I get the game and I know how to play it, but I can't seem to grasp where the fun is. It may be exploration or beating my own high score but I still can't seem to have fun playing it. I'll keep trying and report on it later!
* **A Link to the Past**: I've got to admit I've never beaten this game before! I remember reaching the dark world for the first time on death mountain but I got stuck being a bunny and never could find the Tower of Hera. I'm amazed with the amount of content this SNES game has, so many details, hidden items, the lore, the music. All of this in a single cartridge made in 1992. Damn, I was barely half a year old and these guys were already making history. I can only wish to one day have that much impact in so many persons in the world. One day, you'll see!
* **Roller Coaster Tycoon 2**: I just love this game. I can't say more because It'll need it's own blog post. If you ever get the chance to buy it, make sure to [download this mod](https://openrct2.org/) that re-implements pretty much the whole game while at the same time enhancing it in every way you can imagine.

I think that's most of what I have done on the last two months. I also think my blog is becoming boring and I just narrate random stuff I make up on the fly. But oh well, at least I'm writing something. I'm updating my blog so it can become a professional portfolio instead of a boring online diary. Coming soon!

I've been listening to a lot of J-Pop music lately thanks to The Dude, so my life's soundtrack is currently **Sweet Spider** by **indigo la End**.

<sub>**P.S.**: Enjoy life and be happy. Please be safe and love the people who care about you, you never know what you've got until you lose it. Don't miss the chance to love someone you care about while you have them in this world.</sub>

Bye! Thanks for reading my thoughts!
