<p>This will be great, starting a new blog focused on stuff I'll be creating over time. I think its a nice to have something pressuring you on making new content. I'm really excited to see how this is going to be working out.</p>
<p>Anyways, this is something alien for me as I've never blogged before and I don't know if I should be posting interesting stuff or just speak my mind here (I guess I'll be doing something inbetween). I'll be using this blog to post my work and personal projects and shed them some light, I don't consider myself good but I think maybe some of my stuff deserves something better than being stored on my drive.</p>
<p>Alright I'll start writing the next post and try to do something more interesting rather than introducing myself.</p>
