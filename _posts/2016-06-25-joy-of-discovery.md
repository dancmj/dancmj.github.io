Hello, and welcome to another post in my blog! I have so much stuff in my plate right now and I feel like it's a good moment to write about it before I forget all of it.

## Books

I just got a shit ton of books delivered from amazon, ranging from [marketing](https://www.amazon.com/Culture-Code-Ingenious-Understand-People/dp/0767920570), [game narrative](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1138787086/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), [artificial intelligence](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1493682229/ref=od_aui_detailpages00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and some [other interesting stories](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143122797/ref=od_aui_detailpages00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) you might want to read. I don't know with which one I should start, but I'll definitely finish them all before the end of the year.

I finished [Into the Wild](https://www.amazon.com/Into-Wild-Jon-Krakauer/dp/0385486804) a couple days ago. I feel like going to Alaska now, and that may be a possibility in the near future. Reading about Chris McCandless' actions (although it's all a compilation of what MIGHT have happened) and decisions through his adventures in the wilderness of America was pretty interesting and insightful. It really makes you think about how "Living Life" is pretty subjective for every person on earth. Whatever you might think as being the most joyful experience might be and you'll do whatever you can to accomplish it, others will see you as a madman.

I also read [Masters of Doom](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222146.Masters_of_Doom) a couple months ago. It's amazing how such a small team could accomplish something that big. They pushed everything to the limit and beyond. I recommend this book to anyone interested on reading about how people used to do stuff. Makes you think about how much times have changed and how much the game business has changed.

BTW you can [add me on goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51269345-daniel) if you're into that kind of stuff.

## Vancouver, BC, Canada

So it's official. I'll be attending to the [Vancouver Film School](www.vfs.edu/OfficialSite)'s [Game Design program](https://vfs.edu/programs/game-design) for an entire year, starting in January 3rd 2017. Damn! I think my future as a game designer might be a reality. I don't know if I'll stay there or if I'll come back to Hermosillo. I hope I do whatever I think is the best when the time comes.

I don't know what will happen. I don't know if I'll succeed or if I'll fail, but I'll never find out if I don't try. I know ([not from first hand](https://youtu.be/wOlcB-JxkFw?list=PLtkJ7uLv7p0JMUNBbtMfh3wrkHKnWeyxd)) that making real games and being an indie dev is hard. I know I'll give my 110% effort to the game design program. And I hope I succeed but I don't expect to succeed on my first try or the second, but I'm sure eventually I will create a game worth talking about and make my friends proud.

Also, I recommend anyone interested on game design to check out [this youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtkJ7uLv7p0JMUNBbtMfh3wrkHKnWeyxd) I found on reddit. It has really good topics and interesting talks.

## Now Playing

* **Overwatch**: I can't stop playing this game. Another masterpiece created by Blizzard. I wish to someday work with those guys! I would learn so much!

* **Tomb Raider (2013)**: Pretty good so far, I have only invested a couple hours on this game but I can already tell it's really well crafted. The levels and the controllers make it so simple to navigate around and yet make it fill increasingly dangerous and epic at the same time. Props to the designers!


* **Life is Strange**: I got this as a gift from my friend Livier. This game has a really good story progression and makes you think twice about making any decision even though you can check every outcome of every choice. I started this game without any previous knowledge of it but it's definitely one of my favorites now. The storytelling is just amazing.


* **Ocarina of Time 3D**: Yeah, I always play this again every year or so, along with Majora's Mask. Which reminds me I still have to beat Twilight Princess...

## What's next?

A lot of reading and play more games! I'd like to start Antichamber or replay Portal 2 with the developer commentary. Who knows!

Thanks for reading. Be happy.

Here's a nice song that plays at the ending scene of a really cool game. Make sure to listen to it! You'll love it!
