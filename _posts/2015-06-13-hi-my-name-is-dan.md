Time flies! So much has happened in the last 4 months, including new technologies, friends, music, achievements and goals.

## AngularJS
I've recently started using this and, what can I say? I love using it! I've been implementing it like crazy, even on simple landing page websites. Using AngularJS I learned that creating web-apps is simple and awesome so I created [Hackernation](https://github.com/dancmj/hackernation). I also plan on integrating AngularJS onto this blog and combine Jekyll with it along with some new sweet-smooth CSS, can't wait!

## GO
So, [golang](https://golang.org/) is FAST, I mean it! [Unit testing](http://golang.org/pkg/testing/) is native and, once again, they're incredibly fast AND easy to implement. My favourite parts of it are [pointers](https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/1), structs, [goroutines](https://gobyexample.com/goroutines) and [go get](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#remote). Really, it's like coding on C but a little higher level.

## <s>MutteCreatives</s>
Yep, it's official, MutteCreatives won't exist anymore! We got a new name! It's going to be great! I'll be working as a full stack developer! I'm very excited! So many exclamation marks!

## gaming
I'm finally starting to go back to my gaming side, I've been playing quite alot of different things including [Team Fortress 2](http://www.teamfortress.com/), [Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/) (Legends mode is the best part of this game), [Dungeons & Dragons](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Dungeons_%26_Dragons), [Portal 2 Perpetual Testing Initiative](http://www.thinkwithportals.com/) and [Faster Than Light](http://www.ftlgame.com/). With this, inspiration comes and alot of writing for the storyline of my favorite and most ambitious videogame project is coming together, it's gonna be HUGE! Can't wait until it sees the light of the day!

### What's next for me?
Getting involved in alot of things with alot of people is a problem, I don't have the sufficient time to get involved as much as I'd like to so I end up not working on great projects. Still, things are looking up! I'm pretty happy with what I've accomplished even though it isn't that much. So working on making an alpha of the game is a priority right now, as well as implementing a pretty sweet angular onto this site.

And a song for this post: [CHON - Suda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsTTXeD-J0k), smooth as butter.
