<p>Alright, so I couldn't contain myself and bought <a href="https://www.discoverphaser.com/">Discover Phaser</a> by Thomas Palef and I can't recommend it enough. It is very self explanatory and the examples are very good. I'm actually about to post a modified version of the game that comes within the book which I'll be constantly updating too, I'm just finishing up the new assets! By the way, this one does work on mobile and the flappy bird clone will be soon!</p>
<p>My friend Miguel is a new javascript enthusiast thanks to his new job, he just got me hooked onto the book <a href="http://it-ebooks.info/book/274/">Javascript: The Good Parts</a> which is helping me alot reinforcing the concepts I already had on the language and making clear some things which I had seen but had no idea how they actually worked. I would recommend this book to people who are already into Javascript and want to actually know for sure what is going on and what is happening. </p>
<p>Today I started with the XNA game programming class and it went great! I had never had the experience of teaching to a group of people which had little to no experience on the subject, and they taught me alot too! I'm eagerly waiting the next class on monday.</p>
<p>On a side note, I'm ~20% through (according to my kindle) the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cryptonomicon-Neal-Stephenson/dp/0060512806">Cryptonomicon</a> by Neal Stephenson. It is an amazing science fiction novel so far, I like the way the author explains alot of details about whats exactly going on by using math and how he creates an amazing story based on the mathematical geniuses of the WW2 era.<br> And this post has the name of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=UTVd8g_DBjg#t=1719">song I'm currently listening to</a>.</p>
