<p>Alright, I've been reading alot about game design lately and got two new books:</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00INF6MGA">Game Project Completed</a> by Thomas Schwarzl.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LIYS9F0">Introduction to Game Design, Prototyping, and Development</a> by Jeremy Gibson.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first book is short and focused on what it should, it isn't a book for programmers, it isn't a book for graphic designers, it is a book for for aspiring indie game developers and explains which problems you'll probably be confronting when you're trying to make a game by yourself or with a team while aiming for the top.</p>
<p>The second book, I'm about 24% through it (thanks Kindle!) and I have yet to see a single line of code, which is great! Altough this book contains some projects you follow using Unity3D, most of it guides you through the stuff you actually need to do before your artist starts designing or your programmer starts coding.</p>
<p>My projects right now consist on creating games using Unity3D so I got in touch with my friend Julio from elementary school, he is an amazing artist. We'll be creating some games! I love his style and imagination, definitely someone I look forward to work with. I would link his work but he doesn't have any online, yet.</p>
<p> This post's title comes from Gibson's book, it makes you say it out loud so that you get the idea of what it takes despite the fact that I'm still learning some basic stuff. So yeah, I am a game designer.</p>
