I'm eating the most delicious pizza I've ever had. I'm so happy right now!

Alright, the pizza is gone. So let's start writing.

## g.raffe
Some [months ago I was working on this project](http://dancmj.github.io/blog/2015/07/21/month-7.html) but had to halt development on it since I started studying game design. Since a week ago I've been dedicating all of my free time to this project. It turns out I made a deal with one of my college teachers so I have to finish g.raffe before the semester ends and make it available as a didactic tool over the internet (which has always been the original purpose), so it's a win / win situation! I finish this, and I get my degree!. Here's what I have right now:

<!-- <div id="graffe-canvas"> </div> -->
**Nope. Couldn't minify all of my .js files (I couldn't get gulp to work). Sorry, the preview is unavailable at the moment. But the file is loading... Check the console :D**

As you see, it's still a work in progress! Missing features include tags for the node's name, highlighting for routes and step by step messages for every algorithm.

####In other news...
I spent 1 hour trying to configure my `gulpfile.js` and eventually gave up, but I finished with a colored Nyan reporter again so I'm quite happy!

## Books:
I got myself a physical copy of [Javascript: The Good Parts](http://bdcampbell.net/javascript/book/javascript_the_good_parts.pdf), it's always nice to have physical copies of books you've been reading online, like some sort of memento you get to keep on your shelf. I've been updating my goodreads want-to-read section because I really want to work on my reading habits, so much that I'm reading really short stories to get started. Currently reading [The Yellow Wallpaper](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/99300.The_Yellow_Wallpaper_and_Other_Stories) by Charlotte Perkins Gilman.

## Français
I have a 12 day streak right now on [duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) doing french. French has been a language that I've been wanting to speak since 2011 and I'm now giving it a try! Je suis ravi!

## Now Playing&#58;
* I finished Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, I thought it was fun but no more than that.
* Got killed by a troll in a basement in Zork, I made my own map of the game and everything, really looking forward to beating this one, I have no idea how long is it.
* Played a little bit of [Ori and the Blind Forest](http://store.steampowered.com/app/261570/), this metroidvania looks and plays really well!
* Sobbed while playing [To the Moon](http://store.steampowered.com/app/206440/).
* I beat [Slender: The Arrival](http://www.slenderarrival.com/) while playing with headphones and the windows closed. I really did jump scared sometimes.
* I played an hour of the Witcher 3, I'm getting the hang of it!
* I spent most of my christmas vacations playing Fallout 4. Sometimes 12 hours a day. Whoops!

This was a pretty short post now that I see it. Maybe next month I'll be writing on it once a week so it keeps growing and I don't have to write it all down on a single friday night.

## inish?! wtf?
Okay I just noticed whenever I write `finish` it gets rendered as finish. Seriously I'm not making this up. You can do a `⌘+F` / `Ctrl + F` and look for it. It'll highlight everything that says finish but you can't see the F. Lol.

## Life and other things
Things are going ok. I hope I can write some music soon. I tried hard yesterday but couldn't quite get any of it done, I wish it was as easy as programming. I'll get it someday I guess. Progress is slow, but steady. I'm trying to work on as many things as I can! I'm getting things done, they won't get done by themselves.

This post's song is Love Unlimited by Enemies. I listen to this while programming and studying. Try it and tell me if it works for you as well as it does for me.

Be happy.
