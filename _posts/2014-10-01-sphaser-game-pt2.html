<p>So I named our friend, his name is Frank. Frank is a little bird (or cube, depending on your imagination) who likes flying in 2D spaces while constantly hitting himself on the face unless you help him by pressing the spacebar on your keyboard.</p>

<p>Now that animations and sounds were added to the game, you can see (and hear) how it is now actually starting to feel more like an actual game. I learned how to add sounds, make simple animations, tweens, movements and transitions to the previous monotone game. As I mentioned, the phaser framework makes everything a piece of cake. <a href="https://github.com/dancmj/dancmj.github.io/blob/master/assets/sgames/fbird2/main.js">Check the source code here</a>. </p>
<p>Next, I'll be adding menus and different sprites to make the game look prettier and user friendly.</p>
<p>To make this game, I followed <a href="http://www.lessmilk.com/">Thomas Palef</a>'s tutorials on his website, be sure to check it out.</p>
<p>All the sounds on this game were grabbed from the <a href="http://opengameart.org/">OpenGameArt</a> website. <a href="/assets/sgames/fbird2/credits.html">Here be credits</a>.</p>
