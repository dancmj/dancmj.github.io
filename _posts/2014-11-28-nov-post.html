<p>So this whole month I was preparing some small updates, those small updates kept getting bigger and bigger until I wanted to do a single update for them all. I thought of it for a while but then it seemed like a bad idea, it's alot of content and not all of them are related. I felt that didn't do alot of stuff this month (I got distracted by the game
  <a href="http://www.crimenet.info/gate?returnUrl=/">PAYDAY 2</a>), but now that I see it, I did create some neat stuff!</p>
<h1>Unity3D</h1>
<p>On Unity I finished two games and one game is still on process of being finished (It's going to take a couple weeks since I have to finish some school assignments):</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h4>Apple Catcher (<b>Finished</b>)</h4>
    <p>This game is a clone of the 1981 game
      <a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Kaboom!_(video_game)">Kaboom!</a>
      for the Atari 2600.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Castle Attack (<b>Finished</b>)</h4>
    <p>A game based on the famous game
      <a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Angry_Birds">Angry Birds</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>SHMUP! (<b>WIP</b>)</h4>
    <p>
      <a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Galaga">Galaga!</a>
      Of course I had to create a clone of this game.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>I'll upload a playable web version of the games when I finish them all along with the source code! Also, all of these games wouldn't be possible without
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LIYS9F0/">this</a>
  book which I've mentioned before.</p>
<h1>Graphs</h1>
<p>This semester on my Graph Analysis course I've been creating a series of methods and algorithms for analyzing and testing graphs.
  <a href="http://euler.mat.uson.mx/~e5ingsoft2/graph/">Here is a preview</a>, the final version of this should have a couple algorithms and better functionality. I'll detail most of the process and tools used on its own post.</p>
