<p>A year ago or so I solved some <a href="http://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> problems, since I'm into github now I decided to upload them. Feel free to check them out!</p>
<p>Also, shoutout to my friend <a href="http://eduardoacye.github.io/">Eduardo Acu√±a</a> who has helped me alot not only on Project Euler but on all sorts of problems I get into.</p>
<p>Here is a <a href="https://github.com/dancmj/project-euler">link to the answers</a>.</p>
