<p>So I named this: "Grim vs Ghosts", the little guy you control is named Grim (don't ask me why, I don't know) and the bad guys are called Ghosts. Grim's sole purpose in life is collecting skulls (yeah, they're skulls) and not falling into the lava (the red blocks). Also, in no way I created this game from zero, I've been following the book <a href="https://www.discoverphaser.com/">Discover Phaser</a> which actually has this game as an example, when I "finish" this game I'll start creating a new idea from scratch.</p>
<p>Controls are simple, just move with WASD/Arrow Keys and jump with the spacebar. If you're in mobile just use the touch buttons.</p>
<div id="gameDiv"></div>
<p><br>Currently the highscore is stored locally on your computer, I will be storing it online soon so there can be "actual" highscores with your initials on them.</p>
<p>Since I'm creating games on my own, I did actually borrow some assets that came with the book like the tileset for the map and the sounds, I'll be soon making it completely custom. To create the pixel art I used <a href="http://pyxeledit.com/">Pyxel Edit</a>, it is an amazing tool for creating the sprites and spritesheets I used, it  is very simple to use even for me (and that says alot, I suck at creating drawings and that kind of art).</p>
<p>For the map, I used <a href="http://www.mapeditor.org/">Tiled Map Editor</a> which I have been using for some years actually when making games on XNA. Once again, I recommend this tool for creating both simple and complex tilemaps using multiple layers or triggers, it even exports to JSON!</p>
<p>I'll continue with this project instead of the flappy bird, this game is simple enough for me to actually finish it yet has some challenges that I need to learn how to deal with, like looping music, creating a 'mario bros.' style screen indicating your remaining lives everytime you spawn, powerups and multiple levels. </p>
<p>I'll be soon fixing the graphical errors, creating a new tileset, new sounds and even try to create a looping soundtrack.</p>
