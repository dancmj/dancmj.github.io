<li>I've worked on a couple personal games in the last couple years, mostly on C# (using the XNA Framework) and creating 3D/2D games + scripting on <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity3D</a>.</li>
<li>With my rising interest on coding with Javascript, using the <a href="http://phaser.io/">Phaser Framework</a> I created some really simple games. It is very fun and straighforward.</li>
<p><br>Also, this is supposed to be a list
of the games that I've worked on. I don't
  have any of my projects uploaded into the internet yet, 
  it's just a matter of time before it fills up, at least I hope so.
