<p>Hi, my name is Dan. I'm a computer science student from Hermosillo, MÃ©xico.</p>

<p>I created this blog with the intention that it will keep pushing me on to create new games and interesting projects. Whenever I see a blogpost more than a week old, I feel its about time that I did something new already, right?</p>
<p>By the way, I know this is still the default Jekyll theme but I think its good for a placeholder while my awesome friend Brianda is working on a design for the site, <a href="https://dribbble.com/briandamaldonado">check out her work</a>!</p>
