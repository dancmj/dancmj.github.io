This month has been a busy one, my internship has been keeping me very very occupied, which is great! At the same time that doesn't leave me extra time to spend on other projects, which is bad because I really need to organize my time and spend more of it making the games & prijects I have shelved at the moment (GrimVsGhosts, Unity3D games, graph_.js, web-dev).

### Internship Assignments
Last week for an assignment at my internship I had to complete 3 google code challenges on Go, Dart & Scala which at the time I'd never written on before. I completed the 3 of them on Go & Dart and the week was about to end so I didn't do it on Scala sadly. Here's a simple explanation on how I solved them:

*   [Alien Language](https://github.com/dancmj/google-code-jam/tree/master/solutions/alien-language): This problem was simple, you just need to evaluate some regular expressions and bam! It's done!
*   [Minimum Scalar Product](https://github.com/dancmj/google-code-jam/tree/master/solutions/minimum-scalar-product): Sort both of them, invert one of those, dot product.
*   [T9 Spelling](https://github.com/dancmj/google-code-jam/tree/master/solutions/t9-spelling): Easy peasy with a dictionary.

### lifebuddy
Two days ago, I was playing Magic: The Gathering with my cousin when we were looking online for a life counter, which took us a while because we couldn't find one that was simple enough [so I made one myself](https://github.com/dancmj/web-apps/tree/master/lifecounter)! Took me just a couple hours to make while watching the Oscars with my friends, it was fun. I also erased the whole project while trying some new github commands (I was just about to upload the project to github) so I had to start it again!, good thing it only took me an hour the second time.

### MutteCreative
And finally, [MutteCreative](https://www.behance.net/muttecreative/members) is some steps closer to becoming something bigger and better! [Brianda](https://dribbble.com/briandamaldonado) (one of mutte's designers) will be working alot on it, she had a good idea and used mutte for one of her university assignments.

I wish I had more time to do more stuff (who doesn't?), but I'll just have to make the best of my daily 24 hours; Drink more coffee, maybe? This posts song is **When I Was Young - Blink 182** because I've been singing it like crazy on my car.
