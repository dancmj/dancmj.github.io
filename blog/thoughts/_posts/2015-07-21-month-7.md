Okay! So this month's learnings and feats were nice. These range from new CSS learnings to data structures! Let's see:

##[Atom](https://atom.io/)
Have you seen [Atom's retro commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7aEiVwBAdk)? It's pretty funny!

I've been using Atom to create all of my personal stuff now and I've gotta admit it's really nice. There's nothing I haven't been able to do and apart from that, it looks modern! I'm not going to compare it to sublime or any other text editor, but I would recommend it over sublime. If you're skeptical, you should give it a try!

##[g.raffe](https://github.com/dancmj/g.raffe/)
Yes! My graph-visualization app got a name! It's spelled like giraffe and it is looking really good so far! I'm using [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) for the front end and I'll be using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) on the backend, it'll have just some options to add your github account and save some favourite graphs. [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) will be used for the visualizations part. I already have a [really crude prototype](http://euler.mat.uson.mx/~e5ingsoft2/graph3/graph3/) running on my college's server, it sucks but it's a good concept of what i'd like to accomplish.

Progress on this is on top of my list, I've already got 30~ unit tests and I'm up to [Kruskal's algorithm](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Kruskal's_algorithm)! This is the easy part, mastering d3.js will be the hard part, I guess!

Design of this web-app will be created by my coworkers Andrés and Brianda, looking forward to it!

##edX course
Okay so I enrolled on [this awesome introduction to game design course](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-game-design-mitx-11-126x) on edX, I'll be working on it daily and hopefully finish it soon, I can't keep letting down the gamer inside me. I've already read a couple books on the subject but the business week looks promising, lets see how it goes!

##Inverted Triangle CSS
Who doesn't know what to do when creating Cascading Stylesheets for your websites? Yeah, your .css ends up looking like a mess and you change stuff you didn't even know existed. Obviously, I'm guilty of this too, CSS is so easy to mess up.

[Ryan Irilli](https://twitter.com/ryanirilli) taught me about how the CSS of the web-app we're working on ([points.com](https://www.points.com/)) is structured. That's how I learned about the amazingness of [ITCSS](http://itcss.io/) and how to manage projects with it. The concept is simple, create hierarchies for the components of the site from high specificity to low specificity, I highly recommend [watching this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OKZOV-iLj4&hd=1) if you're interested on writing good CSS.

By the way, take a look at [this awesome CSS animation](http://codepen.io/joshbader/pen/EjXgqr?utm_content=buffer5df05&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer)! Not by me though, although I'd love to make CSS animations someday.

###what else?

I guess that's about it! No more interesting stories, I can't design so my coworkers [Brianda](https://dribbble.com/briandamaldonado) & [Andrés](https://dribbble.com/andresrdz) are working really hard right now on some ultra secret project while I just update my blog. Check out their work!
