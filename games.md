* I've worked on a couple personal games in the last couple years, mostly on C# (using the [XNA Framework](http://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=20914)) and creating 3D/2D games + scripting on [Unity3D](http://unity3d.com/).
* With my rising interest on coding with Javascript, using the [Phaser Framework](http://phaser.io/) I created some really simple games. It is very fun and straighforward.
* Also, this is supposed to be a list of the games that I've worked on. I don't have any of my projects uploaded into the internet yet, it's just a matter of time before it fills up, at least I hope so.
