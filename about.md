title: About Me
---

My name is Daniel Contreras Mejia and I'm from the warm city of Hermosillo, located in México. I'm currently residing on the awesome city of Vancouver, BC. I speak fluent spanish, english and just a little bit of french.

<!-- TODO: Add a picture or something here. -->

This is my blog. I tend to write about whatever endeavor I take and my personal life. I love writing about my learnings, sharing my knowledge, computer science, discussing games and helping other people achieve their own dreams.

I worked as a developer and also as a QA Automation Engineer at Nearsoft, Inc. in México for almost two years. I left that job to pursue my dream of becoming a Game Designer and so far my first step has been to get a degree from the Vancouver Film School which I'm currently working on.

So yeah! That's a little bit about me. Wanna hire me or just talk? Send me an email to <a href="mailto:{{site.email}}">hello@dancmj.net</a> or checkout my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dancmj) if you're more interested on my professional career.

Thanks for reading! Be happy.
