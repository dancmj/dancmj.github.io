Hi, my name is Dan. I'm a computer science student from Hermosillo, MÃ©xico.

I created this blog with the intention that it will keep pushing me on to create new games and interesting projects. Whenever I see a blogpost more than a week old, I feel its about time that I did something new already, right? <-- ***Apparently I haven't been following this rule for a couple months now, shame on me***!

By the way, I know this is still the default Jekyll theme but I think its good for a placeholder while my awesome friend Brianda is working on a design for the site, [check out her work](https://dribbble.com/briandamaldonado)!
