title: Who am I?
---

My name is Daniel Contreras Mejia and I live in the warm city of Hermosillo, located in MÃ©xico.

<!-- TODO: Add a picture or something here. -->

This is my blog! I work hard on it and try my best to make it look awesome and keep it relevant.

## Here is some of the stuff I love doing:

* Full-stack Web Developing at [Born Co](http://www.madebyborn.co/).
* Designing video games, that's my passion.
* QA Automation Engineer at [Nearsoft Inc](http://nearsoft.com/).
* I sometimes play bass on my local pubs and I used to play on [this awesome band](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P--VTcPKd9o)!
* I'm trying to become a [composer too](https://soundcloud.com/dan_ce/sets/soundtrack)!
* I LOVE computer science, data structures and graph theory. I'm making this awesome visualization tool called [g.raffe](https://github.com/dancmj/g.raffe). Check it out and contribute!
* Watching live shows and performances with my friends.
* I also code my own videogames. It's not my favorite part but it's a learning process so I love it!
* And over everything else, I love playing videogames.

So yeah! That's a little bit about me. Wanna hire me or just talk? Send me an email to <a href="mailto:{{site.email}}">hello@dancmj.net</a>!
